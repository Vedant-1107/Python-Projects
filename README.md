# Python Mini-Projects Repository
## üìñ Overview
This repository contains a collection of small Python scripts designed for different use cases, including banking operations, encryption, health potion mechanics in games, and a simple user management system named Travis. Each script demonstrates the use of Python's basic features like object-oriented programming, loops, conditionals, and input handling.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
### Files included:
### 1. bank.py

  Implements a simple banking system with two account types: Current and Saving.
  Features include: deposit, withdrawal with balance checks, and account statements.

### 2. encrypt.py

  A fun encryption script that converts sentences into a "Pig Latin"-like format.
  Translates each word based on whether it starts with a vowel or consonant.
  
### 3. health.py

  Simulates a game mechanic where health is adjusted based on difficulty levels (easy, mid, hard).
  Uses random numbers to determine potion value.

### 4. travis.py

  Implements a simple chatbot named Travis for user management.
  Supports adding/removing names from a known users list.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Banking System (bank.py)

  Handles deposits and withdrawals with balance checks.
  Two types of accounts:
    1. Current: Allows a negative balance up to -1000.
    2. Saving: Minimum balance is 0.

### Text Encryption (encrypt.py)

  Converts words into an encrypted "Pig Latin"-style format.
  Handles vowels and consonants differently.

### Health Potion Game (health.py)
  
  Adjusts player health based on difficulty levels.
  Uses random potion values to simulate unpredictability.

### Travis User Management Bot (travis.py)

  Greets known users and manages a list of users interactively.
  Allows adding or removing users dynamically.
