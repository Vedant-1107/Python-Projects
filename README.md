# Python Mini-Projects Repository
## üìñ Overview
This repository contains a collection of small Python scripts designed for different use cases, including banking operations, encryption, health potion mechanics in games, and a simple user management system named Travis, showcasing a variety of functionalities, from game simulations to utility tools like email slicers. Each script demonstrates the use of Python's basic features like object-oriented programming, loops, conditionals, and input handling.

### 4. encrypt.py

  A fun encryption script that converts sentences into a "Pig Latin"-like format.
  Translates each word based on whether it starts with a vowel or consonant.
  
### 5. health.py

  Simulates a game mechanic where health is adjusted based on difficulty levels (easy, mid, hard).
  Uses random numbers to determine potion value.

### 6. travis.py

  Implements a simple chatbot named Travis for user management.
  Supports adding/removing names from a known users list.
